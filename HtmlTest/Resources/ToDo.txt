ImageMapster:
	- seems to be the way
	- method calls from JS work, all user action can be handled this way
	- JS calls from code behind work as well BUT
		- map areas cannot be styled via CSS
		- must try to make mapster-calls from code behind to fill/edit area fills

If ImageMapster won't work:
either:
	- create modified copies for each(!) field to swap them via JS mouseover
or:
	- try and make SVG AreaMaps work
